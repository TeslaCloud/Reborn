# This is the locale file for your schema.
# Put any phrases you would like translated here.

# While not necessary, it's strongly advised to use
# the languages system rather than hardcoding your strings.

# The basic format looks like this:
# *ISO 639-1 Code of the language*:
#   category_name:
#     phrase_name: "Phrase contents"
#
# Please note that YAML categories act JUST like Lua tables,
# which means that a category CANNOT have a string assigned to it.
